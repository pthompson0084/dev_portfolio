Code Louisville project: a personal portfolio

Once it's fleshed out with some projects and a completed resume, this is a portfolio website I intend to use for my job search. 

The home page uses javascript to rotate through a series of quotations. (Unfortunately I ultimately had to give each quotation its own function. Putting the quotations into an array and running a single function with a for loop and some delay mechanism would not work.)

The links page also uses javascript. When you click a topic button, a list of related links appears.

The contact page does not currently support actual form submission.

FYI, my css is in styles.css (stylesheet.css is just for an imported font).
