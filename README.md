Code Louisville project: a personal portfolio

This is a portfolio website I intend to use for my job search. It is currently "under construction" in that there are no portfolio projects attached yet and I have to complete my resume.

The home page uses javascript to rotate through a series of quotations. (Unfortunately I ultimately had to give each quotation its own function. Putting the quotations into an array and running a single function with a for loop and some delay mechanism would not work. There was never a delay.)

The links page also uses javascript. When you click a topic button, a list of related links appears.
